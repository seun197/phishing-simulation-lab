# ISO27001 Mapping â€“ Phishing Simulation Project

This phishing simulation lab aligns with several ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A controls:

### A.5 Information Security Policies
- **Objective**: Ensure policies support phishing defence.
- **Lab Link**: Campaign setup demonstrates enforcement of security awareness training.

### A.6 Organisation of Information Security
- **Objective**: Roles and responsibilities defined.
- **Lab Link**: Project simulates IT Support role and victim users with clear segregation.

### A.7 Human Resource Security
- **Objective**: Users trained against phishing.
- **Lab Link**: Simulation replicates staff being tested, results show behaviour tracked.

### A.8 Asset Management
- **Objective**: Protect information assets.
- **Lab Link**: Captured credentials treated as sensitive data, demonstrating risk exposure.

### A.12 Operations Security
- **Objective**: Detect and respond to security events.
- **Lab Link**: GoPhish logs, MailHog integration, and exported results provide monitoring evidence.

### A.16 Information Security Incident Management
- **Objective**: Ensure events are reported and handled.
- **Lab Link**: Campaign results (clicked, submitted credentials) provide structured incident evidence.

**Summary**  
This project proves hands-on technical security control mapping, linking phishing simulation directly to ISO27001 Annex A. Hiring managers can see technical execution mapped to compliance requirements.
